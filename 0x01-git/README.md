My README file in 0x01-git

I am trying to practise good README conventions. The problem 
however is how to count the 72 character limit when typing 
the README. I did not count the number of characters I've 
typed per line in this file tho. 

I'll check it out and make my next README.md a standard one.

Future me, this was your first README!
